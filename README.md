# Manage local dotfiles 
### Used together with Thoughtbot's dotfiles

This repo makes managing dotfiles easier since they are version controlled and
can be installed on any machine. These files work together with thoughtbot's
dotfiles to create a rich Tmux and Vim environment.

1. Ensure you have thoughtbot's dot files installed ([Repo!](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git)
2. git clone https://github.com/loganrice/dotfiles_local.git
3. Run the shell script to create the symlinks (./create_symlinks.sh)
